# bump

Best Universal Music Player written in Rust and iced
(not quite the best, but I'm trying my best)

## Configuration

Config files are saved in config folder (on Linux `~/.config/bump`) in file
`config.json`. There's not much options yet, but I'm planning to add others.

## GUI

Currently there's not much GUI. Currently the GUI is in state for testing.

## Library for playing audio

I use library coded by my friend, so thanks!
The library is called [raplay](https://github.com/BonnyAD9/raplay).
